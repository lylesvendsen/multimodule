MultiModule
===========

Multi Module plug-in for ColdFusion on Wheels (cfwheels.org)

This plugin allows multiple modules under a single wheels application. This allows developers to develop, test, and release each module independently. A module is a group of models, controllers and views stored under a single folder per module
